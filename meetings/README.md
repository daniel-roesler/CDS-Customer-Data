This is the archive of meetings for the CDS Customer Data working group (WG3).

## Notes
* Prior July 2024, the Customer Data working group encompassed both Registration and Customer Data specifications and was called CDSC Customer Data WG1. After July 2024, WG1 was renamed to Connectivity WG1 and continued to maintain the first two specifications (Server Metadata and Registration), and Customer Data was reorganized into to Customer Data WG3 to maintain the third specification (Customer Data).
* Between July 2024 and June 2025, WG1 and WG3 held joint working group meetings for all three specifications, so the meeting minutes for that time period represent joint working group meetings.
* In July 2025, the project was renamed from CDSC to CDS (Connected Data Specifications), the Connectivity working group (WG1) was renamed to the Registration working group (WG1), and the two working groups (WG1 and WG3) started having separate meetings. You can find the CDS Registration WG1 meeting minutes for July 2025 onward in the WG1 repository: https://github.com/lfe-cds/CDS-Registration/tree/main/meetings
